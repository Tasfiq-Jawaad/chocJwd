# chocJwd: A wearable split mechanical keyboard project

## Overview

I started this project as a gateway to simple custom mechanical keyboard but it very quickly evolved into something that I use everyday and specially, it solves a few real-world problem I was facing.
Introducing chocJwd, a custom mechanical keyboard and accessories project that features a pair of detachable armrest and a pair of strapping mechanism (more on that soon).

## The case
### Modifications
I’m using the [chocofi case](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi/tree/main/case/v1), but I modified it to be slightly taller. This gives me enough room inside for some sound‑enhancing tweaks (to make it really “thock”). Who says custom ergonomic split keyboards can’t sound great, right?
Since I plan to use the keyboard with tenting, I don’t mind if it isn’t ultra low‑profile. I’m happy to trade a bit of _low‑profile_ for better typing sound. It’s still slimmer than a traditional keyboard though.

# I'll be adding more details very soon
